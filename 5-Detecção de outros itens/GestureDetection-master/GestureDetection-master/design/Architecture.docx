The program is broken into 4 different files, which can be found in current_src:

testImplementation.py
GesturesApi.py
gesture.py
defaultGesturesLoader.py

In addition, the program uses a file taken from the 15-112 course notes:

eventBasedAnimationClass.py

Explanations for individual files are below:

testImplementation.py:
	Example code showing how to use the API
	Creates 1 window with 4 quadrants
		3 quadrants used for drawing API information
		1 quadrant used as a canvas
	Uses event based programming with Tkinter to draw smiley faces
	Can use gestures to create and move smiley face
	Contains methods to draw, handle events, and modify smiley faces
	Run this file to see the example

GesturesApi.py:
	Contains the GestureProcessor object
	Determines the hand's contour, center, and gesture
	Loads a list of template Gesture objects which it compares against
	Loads from either file or defaultGesturesLoader
	Gets the camera feed and looks for Gestures
	Calls each Gesture template's compare method
	Decides which Gesture is matched, if any
	Calls the appropriate gesture's callback
	Provides methods for the programmer to display images

gesture.py:
	Contains the Gesture class
	Each Gesture is a template containing many points
	Has a static method to compare a given gesture to self
	Contains callback to be called when gesture is detected

defaultGesturesLoader.py
	Generates the Gesture templates to be used by GesturesApi
	Generated upon import, simply need to access internal variable

eventBasedAnimationClass.py:
	Provides the basic functions and wrappers needed to make event based 			programming in Tkinter work
	Used by CMU 15-112 students
